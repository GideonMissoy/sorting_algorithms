# sorting_algorithms
This is my directory for the Sorting Algorithms assignment,
and contains code that I wrote to answer The 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
assignment tasks.

This directory is meant to help expound and improve understanding on:
- The types of sorting Algorithms.
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given output.
- What is a stable sorting algorithm.
